## Description

This project is a simple project I created to answer one question I have: which is the fastest way to iterate through `mongodb.find` results.
For testing that, I've created a free-tier atlas cluster and loaded sample data.

The collection used for testing in my case had around 40k results.

My testing indicates `toArray` is a better approach, but I'm a bit unsure about it. Some more rounds of testing may be needed.
